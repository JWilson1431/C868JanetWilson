This is an improved version of the C195 scheduling application. New features were added to make this a scheduling application for an online telemedicine service. The application
connects to a MYSQL database.
Customers can be categorized as male or female. Different attributes are included depending on the gender of the customer. This project starts with a log in screen that the user can
use to log in to the application. If the user has an appointment within 15 minutes an alert reminds them of the appointment. If they do not have an upcoming appointment, 
the user is notified that they have successfully logged in and that they have no upcoming appointments. The user is taken to the main screen which has a list of all customers
and a list of all appointments. They can navigate to the customers section or the appointment section. The customer screen displays a list of female customers and a
list of male customers. Customers can be added, updated, or deleted. The update screen automatically populates the customers information. The information on the add customer screen changes
depending on whether the male or female button is clicked. The appointment screen can be displayed by all appointments, monthly appointments, or weekly appointments. Appointments
can be added, updated, or deleted. Appointments cannot overlap and must be within business hours.
